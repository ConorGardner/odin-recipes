        <h1>Italian Meatballs</h1>

        <h3>What You're Making</h3>
        <p>
            These are my idea of "perfect" meatballs. I make them extra soft and juicy by using bread instead of breadcrumbs, and the grated onion is my secret tip for adding extra flavour into this. Plus, no need to sauté diced onion before mixing it in! Served with a rich tomato sauce made extra tasty by cooking it in the same pan that the meatballs are browned in.

        <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
        <h5>Meatballs</h5>
        <ul>

            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>14 oz / 400 g ground beef </li>
            <li>3 oz / 100g ground pork</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>

            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>

        <h5>Cooking Meatballs & Sauce</h5>

    <h3>What You Need To Do</h3>
    <h5>Preparing The Meatballs</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Grate the onion using a standard box grater in a large bowl until you have about 1/2 cup of grated onion and juices. </li>
        <li>Add bread, mix to combine so the onion juice soaks the bread and disintegrates. Set aside while you prep the other ingredients (5 min or so).</li>
        <li>Add all the remaining Meatball ingredients. Use hands to mix well.</li>
        <li>Measure out a heaped tablespoon and roll lightly to form a ball. Repeat with remaining mixture. (Note 5)</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil in a large non stick fry pan over medium high heat. Add the meatballs and brown all over - about 3 - 4 minutes</li>
        <li>When they are browned but NOT cooked through, carefully transfer them onto a plate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Cooking The Meatballs & Sauce</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil into the fry pan. </li>
        <li>Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until translucent. Add the remaining Sauce ingredients. Bring to a simmer, then turn down to medium low so it bubbles gently rather than splattering everywhere.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the meatballs and any juices that have pooled on the plate into the Sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook the meatballs for 8 - 10 minutes, turning and stirring occasionally. Adjust Sauce salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>While the meatballs are cooking, cook your pasta of choice.</li>
        <li>Serve the meatballs on pasta, garnished with extra parmesan and parsley if using.</li>
    </ol>
