        <h3>What You're Making</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Philly Cheesesteak</strong> with tender ribeye steak, melted gooey provolone, and caramelized onions hugged by a toasted garlic butter hoagie roll. This is the classic way to make a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich!
        </p>
        <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Ribeye steak, trimmed and thinly sliced*</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Sea salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 sweet onion, (large), diced</li>
            <li>8 slices provolone cheese, mild (not aged provolone)</li>
            <li>4 Hoagie Rolls, sliced 3/4 through</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, pressed</li>
            <li>2-4 Tbsp mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
    <h3>What You Need To Do</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice hoagie rolls 3/4 of the way through with a serrated knife. Dice onions and thinly slice beef.*</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together 2 Tbsp softened butter with 1 pressed garlic clove. Spread garlic butter onto the cut sides of 4 hoagie roll. Toast the buns on a large skillet, flat cooktop or griddle on medium heat until golden brown then set aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 Tbsp oil to your pan/cooktop and sautee diced onions until caramelized then transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Increase to high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Spread the super thinly sliced steak in an even layer. Let brown for a couple of minutes undisturbed then flip and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Sautee until steak is fully cooked through then stir in the caramelized onions.</li>
        <li>Divide into 4 even portions and top each with 2 slices of cheese and turn off the heat so the cheese will melt without overcooking the meat.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of mayo on the toasted side of each roll. Working with one portion at a time, place a toasted bun over each portion and use a spatula to scrape the cheesy beef into your bun as you flip it over. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Recipe Notes</h4>
    <p>
        *For easier slicing, cover and freeze your steak for 30-40 minutes (freeze a thicker steak 40 min and a thinner steak 30 min).
